## Day 1

### The `Lab Performance` dilemma

Yagami and Ruyk are in the same "Introductory C Programming Class". Surprised? Don't be! There's more.
They want to get good marks with their lab performance. (Who wants to miss an easy A+ in C programming lab, right?) Now, Yagami is happy *IF* he gets more marks than Ruyk and Ruyk is happy *IF* Yagami can't score more marks than him. But, the teachers aren't so easygoing. Sometimes, they give negative marking.  :disappointed: No one is happy if he gets some mark **m** less than **0**.
 
 Given the marks of Yagami and Ruyk, can you predict their mood?
 :smiley_cat:    :crying_cat_face:
 
 In a single line there will be two integers the score of Yagami <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_1" />  and score of Ruyk <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?m_2" /> Print two strings *"happy"* or *"non_happy"* based on the statement.
